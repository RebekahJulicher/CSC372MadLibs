We used VSCode for this, so for full replication, use that.
You don't need the C# extension, but it wouldn't hurt to install it

# Installation

## Downloading .NET Core SDK
Download and install the .NET Core SDK at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/sdk-for-vs-code

## Download Repository
In the terminal, type: `git clone https://github.com/RebekahJulicher/CSC372MadLibs.git`

# Running
1. Open repository in VSCode (Directory should be something like: `C:\dev\Repos\CSC372MadLibs\CSC372MadLibs>`)
1. Open Program.cs in VSCode
2. Enable View > Terminal
3. Type “dotnet run” in the terminal command line
`C:\dev\Repos\CSC372MadLibs\CSC372MadLibs> dotnet run`

The program should now be running.
