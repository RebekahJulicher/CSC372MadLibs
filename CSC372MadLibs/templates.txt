Every once in a while I like to go out for a {noun}, and then I like to go back home and {verb} {plnoun} for a while.

{plnoun} are very cool, {plnoun}, on the other hand... are kinda {adjective}.

My name is {noun}. I’m {integer} years old. My house is in the northeast section of {place}, where all the {plnoun} are, and I am not {adjective}. I work as a {noun} for the {noun} store, and I get home every day by {integer} PM at the latest. I don’t {verb}, but I occasionally {verb}. I’m in bed by {integer} PM, and make sure I get {integer} hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm {noun} and doing about {integer} minutes of {noun} before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a {noun}, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
